                <p>gener8tor and The Mill partnered with Microsoft and LinkedIn to offer a coding and web development program.
                  As a participant my main objective was to translate what I was learning into a website project. The result is the site where you find yourself today!
                  Throughout this program I learned multiple coding and programming languages. These languages include HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, 
                  C#/.NET, Java and SQL. This provided me with a well-rounded understanding of front-end, back-end, and database related technologies.
                  This site is a reflection of some of those skills I acquired through the Code School program.

                    <p>I was lucky enough to participate in gener8tor's gAlpha Indy 5G venture creation workshop during May 2020.
                      As a part of the program we were tasked with ideating and building potential tech solutions within many different industries across the world.
                      From the first meeting and throughout the following weeks an idea kept resonating with me within the sports and event industry. I looked at a gap in the fan experience. Thru my recent experiences of attending 
                      my favorite sporting event along with the gaps or challenges I had that could have been improved,
                       guided, or eliminated altogether. Through the workshop and continuous conversations with the gAlpha team I pursued the idea that ultimately turned into 1Fan.
